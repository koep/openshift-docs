= Tasks

_Tasks_ are the building blocks of a Pipeline and consist of sequentially executed Steps. Tasks are reusable and can be used in multiple Pipelines.

_Steps_ are a series of commands that achieve a specific goal, such as building an image. Every Task runs as a pod and each Step runs in its own container within the same pod. Because Steps run within the same pod, they have access to the same volumes for caching files, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

The following example shows the `apply-manifests` Task.

----
<1> Task API version `v1beta1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `Task`.
<3> Unique name of this Task.
<4> Lists the parameters and Steps in the Task and the workspace used by the Task.

This Task starts the pod and runs a container inside that pod using the `maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim` image to run the specified commands. It receives an input directory called `workspace-git` that contains the source code of the application.

The Task only declares the placeholder for the Git repository, it does not specify which Git repository to use. This allows Tasks to be reusable for multiple Pipelines and purposes.
