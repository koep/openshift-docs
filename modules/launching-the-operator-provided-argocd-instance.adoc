= Launching the Operator provided Argo CD instance

Red Hat OpenShift GitOps uses Argo CD to manage specific cluster-scoped resources, including: platform operators, optional Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) operators, and user management.

To launch the Argo CD instance for your cluster configuration, ensure that the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator is installed on your cluster. After the Operator is installed, it is applicable to all namespaces on the entire cluster. When you install the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator, it automatically sets up a ready-to-use Argo CD instance that is available in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, and an Argo CD icon is displayed in the console toolbar.

After you install the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator, launch into the Argo CD instance from the *Console Application Launcher* to use Argo CD.
