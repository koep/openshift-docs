= Mirroring an Operator catalog

You can mirror the Operator content of a Red Hat-provided catalog, or a custom catalog, into a container image registry using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command. The target registry must support link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]. For a cluster on a restricted network, this registry can be one that the cluster has network access to, such as a mirror registry created during a restricted network cluster installation.

The `oc adm catalog mirror` command also automatically mirrors the index image that is specified during the mirroring process, whether it be a Red Hat-provided index image or your own custom-built index image, to the target registry. You can then use the mirrored index image to create a catalog source that allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to load the mirrored catalog onto your {product-title} cluster.

For the steps in this procedure, the target registry is an existing mirror registry that is accessible by both your cluster and a workstation with unrestricted network access.

.Prerequisites

* Workstation with unrestricted network access
* `podman` version 1.9.3+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps. For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

. On your workstation with unrestricted network access, use the `podman login` command to authenticate with the target mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login <mirror_registry>
----

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
. Authenticate with `registry.redhat.io`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----
endif::[]

. The `oc adm catalog mirror` command extracts the contents of an index image to generate the manifests required for mirroring. You can choose either of the following:
+
--
* Allow the default behavior of the command to automatically mirror all of the image content from the index image, as well as the index image itself, to your mirror registry after generating manifests.
* Add the `--manifests-only` flag to only generate the manifests required for mirroring, but do not actually mirror the image content to the registry yet. This can be useful for reviewing what will be mirrored, and it allows you to make any changes to the mapping list if you only require a subset of packages. You can then use that file with the `oc image mirror` command to mirror the modified list of images in a later step.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `--manifests-only` flag is intended for advanced selective mirroring of content from the catalog. The `opm index prune` command, if you used it previously to prune the index image, is suitable for most use cases.
====
--
+
On your workstation with unrestricted network access, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <index_image> \//<1>
    <mirror_registry>:<port> \//<2>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<3>
    [--insecure] \//<4>
    [--index-filter-by-os='<platform>/<arch>'] \//<5>
    [--manifests-only] <6>
----
<1> Specify the index image for the catalog you want to mirror. For example, this might be a pruned index image that you created previously, or one of the source index images for the default catalogs, such as `{index-image-pullspec}`.
<2> Specify the target registry to mirror the Operator content to.
<3> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file.
<4> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the `--insecure` flag.
<5> Optional: Specify which platform and architecture of the index image to select when multiple variants are available. Images are passed as `'<platform>/<arch>[/<variant>]'`. This does not apply to images referenced by the index. Valid values are `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
<6> Optional: Only generate the manifests required for mirroring and do not actually mirror the image content to a registry.

.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
src image has index label for database path: /database/index.db
using database path mapping: /database/index.db:/tmp/153048078
wrote database to /tmp/153048078 <1>
...
wrote mirroring manifests to manifests-{index-image}-1614211642
----
<1> Directory for the temporary `index.db` database generated by the command.
+
After running the command, a `manifests-<index_image_name>-<random_number>/` directory is created in the current directory and generates the following files:
+
--
* The `catalogSource.yaml` file is a basic definition for a `CatalogSource` object that is pre-populated with your index image tag and other relevant metadata. This file can be used as is or modified to add the catalog source to your cluster.
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror` command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you used the `--manifests-only` flag in this step and want to further trim the subset of packages to be mirrored, see the steps in the _Mirroring a Package Manifest Format catalog image_ procedure about modifying your `mapping.txt` file and using the file with the `oc image mirror` command. After following those further actions, you can continue this procedure.
====

. Create the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f ./manifests-{index-image}-<random_number>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

You can now create a `CatalogSource` object to reference your mirrored index image and Operator content.
