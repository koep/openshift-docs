If you have cluster administrator permissions and have created a channel, you can create a subscription to connect your broker to a subscriber by using the Administrator perspective in the web console.

* You have cluster administrator permissions for {product-title}.
* You have created a channel.
* You have created a Knative service to use as a subscriber.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Serverless* -> *Eventing*.
. In the *Channel* tab, select the Options menu {kebab} for the channel that you want to add a subscription to.
. Click *Add Subscription* in the list.
. In the *Add Subscription* dialogue box, select a *Subscriber* for the subscription. The subscriber is the Knative service that will receive events from the channel.
