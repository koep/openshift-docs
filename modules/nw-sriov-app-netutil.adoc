= DPDK library for use with container applications

An link:https://github.com/openshift/app-netutil[optional library], `app-netutil`, provides several API methods for gathering network information about a pod from within a container running within that pod.

This library is intended to assist with integrating SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) in Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) mode into the container.
The library provides both a Golang API and a C API.

Currently there are three API methods implemented:

`GetCPUInfo()`:: This function determines which CPUs are available to the container and returns the list to the caller.

`GetHugepages()`:: This function determines the amount of hugepage memory requested in the `Pod` spec for each container and returns the values to the caller.

[NOTE]
====
Exposing hugepages via Kubernetes Downward API is an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.20 and is not enabled in {product-title}. The API can be tested by enabling the feature gate, `FEATURE_GATES="DownwardAPIHugePages=true"` on Kubernetes 1.20 or greater.
====

`GetInterfaces()`:: This function determines the set of interfaces in the container and returns the list, along with the interface type and type specific data.

There is also a sample Docker image, `dpdk-app-centos`, which can run one of the following DPDK sample applications based on an environmental variable in the pod-spec: `l2fwd`, `l3wd` or `testpmd`. This Docker image provides an example of integrating the `app-netutil` into the container image itself. The library can also integrate into an `init-container` which collects the required data and passes the data to an existing DPDK workload.
