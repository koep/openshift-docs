= Network attachment definition for an egress router in {router-type} mode

Before a pod can act as an egress router, you must specify the network interface configuration as a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. The object specifies information such as the IP address to attach to the egress router pod, the network destinations, and a network gateway. As the pod for the egress router starts, Multus uses the network attachment definition to add a network interface with the specified properties to the pod.

apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: egress-router-redirect  <.>
spec:
  config: '{
    "cniVersion": "0.4.0",
    "type": "egress-router",
    "name": "egress-router",
    "ip": {
      "addresses": [
        "192.168.12.99/24"  <.>
        ],
      "destinations": [
        "192.168.12.91/32"  <.>

<.> The name of the network attachment definition is used later in the specification for the egress router pod.

<.> The `addresses` key specifies the reserved source IP address to use with the additional network interface. Specify a single IP address in CIDR notation, such as `192.168.12.99/24`.

<.> The `destinations` key specifies a single IP address in CIDR notation that the egress router sends packets to. The network address translation (NAT) tables for the egress router pod are configured so that connections to the cluster IP address of the pod are redirected to the same port on the destination IP address. Using this example, connections to the pod are redirected to `192.168.12.91`, with a source IP address of `192.168.12.99`.

<.> The `gateway` key specifies the IP address for the network gateway.
