= Creating a trigger by using the Administrator perspective

If you have cluster administrator permissions and have created a broker, you can create a trigger to connect your broker to a subscriber by using the Administrator perspective in the web console.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions for {product-title}.
* You have created a broker.
* You have created a Knative service to use as a subscriber.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Serverless* -> *Eventing*.
. In the *Broker* tab, select the Options menu {kebab} for the broker that you want to add a trigger to.
. Click *Add Trigger* in the list.
. In the *Add Trigger* dialogue box, select a *Subscriber* for the trigger. The subscriber is the Knative service that will receive events from the broker.
. Click *Add*.
