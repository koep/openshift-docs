= About EFI mode for virtual machines

Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), like legacy BIOS, initializes hardware components and operating system image files when a computer starts. EFI supports more modern features and customization options than BIOS, enabling faster boot times.

It stores all the information about initialization and startup in a file with a `.efi` extension, which is stored on a special partition called EFI System Partition (ESP). The ESP also contains the boot loader programs for the operating system that is installed on the computer.


[NOTE]
====
{VirtProductName} only supports a virtual machine (VM) with Secure Boot when using EFI mode. If Secure Boot is not enabled, the VM crashes repeatedly. However, the VM might not support Secure Boot. Before you boot a VM, verify that it supports Secure Boot by checking the VM settings.
